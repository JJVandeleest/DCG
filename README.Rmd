The **goal** of the README.md is to answer the following questions about your package:

* Why should I use it?
* How do I use it?
* How do I get it?

On GitHub, the README.md will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.

* A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.

* An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.
 - use the english faculty package
 
* Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.

* An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.
