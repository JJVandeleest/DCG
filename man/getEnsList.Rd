\title{generating a list of ensemble matrices based on the similarity matrix and temperatures
\code{getEnsList} get ensemble matrices from given similarity matrix at all temperatures}
\usage{
getEnsList(simMat, temperatures, MaxIt = 1000, m = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{simMat}{a similarity matrix}

\item{temperatures}{temperatures selected}

\item{MaxIt}{number of iterations for regulated random walks}

\item{m}{maxiumnum number of time a node can be visited during random walks}
}
\value{
a list of ensemble matrices
}
\description{
generating a list of ensemble matrices based on the similarity matrix and temperatures
\code{getEnsList} get ensemble matrices from given similarity matrix at all temperatures
}
\details{
This step is crucial in finding community structure based on the similarity matrix of the social network.
For each \code{temperatures}, the similarity matrix was taken to the power of \code{temperature} as saved as a new similarity matrix.
This allows the random walk to explore the similarity matrix at various variations.
Random walks are then performed in similarity matrices of various temperatures.
In order to prevent random walks being stucked in a locale, the parameter \code{m} was set (to \code{5} by default) to remove a node after \code{m} times of visits of the node.
An ensemble matrix is generated at each temperature in which values represent likelihood of two nodes being in the same community.
